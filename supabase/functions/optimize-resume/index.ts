    As an expert ATS optimization specialist, optimize this resume against the job description with STRICT LIMITATIONS on what you can add or modify.

    CRITICAL RULES - DO NOT VIOLATE:
    1. NEVER add sections that don't exist in the original resume (Education, Certifications, specific companies, degrees, etc.)
    2. NEVER add placeholder text like "[Company Name]", "[Year]", "[Certification Name]", "TBD", etc.
    3. NEVER invent specific experiences, companies, schools, certifications, or achievements
    4. NEVER add sensitive information like specific workplace names, educational institutions, or credentials not mentioned
    5. ONLY enhance and rewrite existing content for better ATS compatibility
    6. ONLY add general, non-sensitive sections if they don't exist but are crucial (like TECHNICAL SKILLS)
    7. NEVER include emojis, special characters, or non-standard symbols in the optimized resume
    8. REMOVE all emojis and special characters from the original resume content when creating the optimized version

    ESSENTIAL SECTIONS ONLY:
    Only the following sections should be included in the optimized resume (and ONLY if they exist in the original resume):
    - Contact Information
    - Professional Summary
    - Work Experience
    - Education
    - Skills (Technical Skills)
    - Certifications
    - Projects
    - Awards/Honors
    - Achievements
    - Languages
    - Volunteer Experience
    - Hobbies/Interests

    If any important or strong content from the original resume exists in other sections, it should be relocated to fit into one of the essential sections above rather than creating new non-standard sections.

    WHAT YOU CAN DO:
    - Rewrite existing bullet points with stronger action verbs and quantified results
    - Reorganize existing content for better ATS readability
    - Add relevant keywords from job description to existing experiences (naturally)
    - Improve formatting with standard ATS section headers
    - Add a TECHNICAL SKILLS section if it doesn't exist (using only skills mentioned in existing content)
    - Enhance existing achievements with better formatting and stronger language
    - Relocate important content from non-standard sections into the essential sections listed above
    - Clean and standardize text by removing emojis and special characters

    MANDATORY ATS FORMATTING:
    1. Use ONLY these standardized section headers (exactly as written):
       - PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY (if summary/objective exists in original)
       - PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE (for work experience)
       - TECHNICAL SKILLS (only if skills are mentioned in original content or crucial for role)
       - EDUCATION (ONLY if education section exists in original)
       - PROJECTS (ONLY if projects section exists in original)
       - CERTIFICATIONS (ONLY if certifications exist in original)
       - ACHIEVEMENTS (ONLY if achievements/awards exist in original)
       - AWARDS AND HONORS (ONLY if awards/honors exist in original)
       - LANGUAGES (ONLY if languages exist in original)
       - VOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE (ONLY if volunteer experience exists in original)
       - HOBBIES AND INTERESTS (ONLY if hobbies/interests exist in original)

    2. Section header formatting:
       - Each section header in ALL CAPS
       - Under each header, add a line of equal signs (=) matching header length
       - Use bullet points (‚Ä¢) for all items under sections
       - Consistent spacing between sections
       - NO emojis, special symbols, or decorative characters

    3. Content enhancement rules:
       - Match keywords from job description naturally within existing experiences
       - Quantify existing achievements with numbers/percentages where logical
       - Use strong action verbs for existing responsibilities
       - Ensure ATS-friendly formatting (no special characters, tables, or complex formatting)
       - Replace any emojis or special characters with appropriate text or remove them entirely

    EXAMPLE of what NOT to do:
    ‚ùå Adding "CERTIFICATIONS" section if none exist in original
    ‚ùå Adding "Bachelor's Degree - [University Name]" if education not mentioned
    ‚ùå Adding "Google Cloud Certified - [Year]" if no certifications mentioned
    ‚ùå Adding placeholder companies like "[Previous Company] - Software Developer"
    ‚ùå Creating non-standard sections like "Publications" or "Research" - relocate to essential sections
    ‚ùå Including emojis like "üíª Technical Skills" or "üèÜ Achievements"
    ‚ùå Using special characters like ‚òÖ, ‚ô¶, ‚Üí, or decorative symbols

    EXAMPLE of what TO do:
    ‚úÖ Rewriting "Worked on software projects" to "Developed and maintained software applications, improving system performance by implementing efficient algorithms"
    ‚úÖ Adding TECHNICAL SKILLS section with "JavaScript, Python, SQL" if these are mentioned in existing experience
    ‚úÖ Improving "Managed team" to "Led cross-functional team of 5 developers, resulting in 25% faster project delivery"
    ‚úÖ Moving research publications to ACHIEVEMENTS section instead of creating a "Publications" section
    ‚úÖ Converting "üíª Software Developer" to "Software Developer"
    ‚úÖ Changing "‚òÖ Top Performer" to "Top Performer" or "High-Performing Employee"

    After optimizing, identify any missing qualifications from the job description that the candidate would need to genuinely acquire (don't suggest adding fake credentials).

    Job Description:
    ${jobDescription}

    Original Resume:
    ${resumeContent}

    Please respond with a JSON object containing the optimized resume and qualification gaps:
    {
      "optimizedResume": "the conservatively optimized resume content with proper ATS formatting using only essential sections and no emojis or special characters",
      "qualificationGaps": [
        {
          "skill": "qualification name",
          "importance": "Critical/Important/Nice to have",
          "howToAcquire": "honest advice on how to genuinely acquire this qualification"
        }
      ]
    }
